# Razer Blade Advanced 15" 2018 Hackintosh OpenCore

## Disclaimer
This repository has no other purpose but sharing.
I want to share my hackintosh configuration for this particular laptop with the whole world.
This is not a step by step guide, rather a thing that can greatly help you on your way of turning this or similar laptop into a hackintosh.
Though you can just grab and use this if you have same or very similar laptop model, I greatly encourage you not do so, but instead read all the things I will mention below and get some knowledge.
